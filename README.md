## Why ?

**Real life example: where this could be used**

Your favorite bar has added a giant selection of beers to their menu. 325 new beers to be exact. Because not everyone has the time, or liver, to try all these new beers, the bartender has asked you to develop an application to help the customers decide their drink.
